<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><span>After you have determined that a prompt engineering solution is appropriate for your use case, you need to make a plan. This is where a set of targeted questions can play a vital role. By using these questions as an outline, project managers and developers can effectively shape their vision, define the problem they are solving, and identify the stakeholders and end-users of the solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These questions help establish the importance of solving the problem, assess the impact on stakeholders, determine data storage and hosting needs, and set realistic project timelines. Through a systematic approach to addressing these questions, a solid foundation is laid, enabling a comprehensive and well-informed prompt strategy that aligns with the project's objectives.</span></p>
<p><span>With a clear outline in place, it‚Äôs time to comb through the details of your project and use your domain knowledge and experience to identify areas where prompt engineering will improve your workflow. That is where the Project Optimization Checklist comes into play.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For this exercise, you will work through the process of identifying your goals and digging into the details of your project to find areas where prompt engineering can enhance your workflow. Then, you can use this plan to apply what you have learned in real-life situations.</span></p>
